# Regeneration of Standing Rock’s Lakota and Dakota Nations

## Overview
Addressing environmental and socio-economic challenges in Standing Rock’s Lakota and Dakota Nations, focusing on people, land, water, and air.

## Local Setup
- Install Node v16, I recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- `cd Citizen-Science` to enter the React Native project
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npx expo start` to start the Expo server
- Download the Expo app on your phone and scan the QR code to run the app on your phone
- Install Docker Desktop
- Now `cd` into the `api` directory
- Run `docker-compose build` to build the API and PostgreSQL image
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the API and PostgreSQL server
- You can now access the API at `localhost:3000`, check `/health`

## Challenges & Focus
- **Challenges:** Poverty, unemployment, limited healthy living options, restricted data access.
- **Regeneration Focus:** Environmental issues, language identity, health impacts of air and water, healthy food systems, technology access, sustainable living.
